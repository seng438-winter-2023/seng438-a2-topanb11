# 1 Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to utilize black-box testing to perform unit tests on two different classes DataUtilities and the Range class. We will be writing unit tests based on the requirements of 5 methods in each class. To carry out these tests, we will be using proper black-box testing techniques such as boundary value testing (BVT) and equivalence class testing (ECT). By following this procedure, it will ensure that our tests are thorough and cover all possible cases.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

For our unit testing strategy, we started off by planning how we would perform our tests before writing any code. This involved reading the javadoc documentation for the Range and DataUtilities class to ensure we understand the requirements of each of the following classes. After we understood the requirements of the assigned methods, we applied black-box testing techniques to ensure we tested every method thoroughly and covered all possible cases. We utilized a combination of boundary value testing (BVT) along with equivalence class testing (ECT) to do so. 

For the Range class, since we were dealing with values that were in between two arbitrary values, we mainly used BVT to perform our tests. The reason we utilized BVT for our tests is because there are clear distinguishable boundaries in the Range class. This made it relatively simple to test the various bounds including: below lower bound, at the lower bound, within the bounds, at the upper bound and above the upper bound. Since each bound was able to be tested with ease, this allowed us to cover all possible cases and possible edge cases. Mocking was not necessary when testing the methods since the Range class did not depend on any external classes. Due to that, we were able to successfully perform unit testing on the Range class.

# 3 Test cases developed

|---|---|---|---|---|
| getLengthTestDifferentValues()  | Testing the getLength() method to see if it returns the correct difference between the upper and lower bound when they are different values | 10.0   | 10.0  | Pass  |
| getLengthTestEqualValues()  |   |   |   |   |
| getUpperBoundTestDifferentValues()  |   |   |   |   |
| getUpperBoundTestEqualValues()  |   |   |   |   |
